# Metric Aggregator

![CI](https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-metrics-aggregator/workflows/CI/badge.svg) ![GitHub release (latest SemVer including pre-releases)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/newrelic/nr1-metrics-aggregator?include_prereleases&sort=semver) [![Snyk](https://snyk.io/test/github/newrelic/nr1-network-telemetry/badge.svg)](https://snyk.io/test/github/newrelic/nr1-metrics-aggregator)

## Usage

The Metric Aggregator is a New Relic ONE Application that helps you create an Event To Metric (E2M) rule. Events-to-metrics is a New Relic real-time streaming service that converts event data into dimensional metrics at ingest. New Relic stores these Metrics for 13+ months used for long-term trending.

For additional details on what E2M is and why you would use it, see [Events-to-Metrics in the New Relic documentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/data-ingest-apis/get-data-new-relic/metric-api/introduction-events-metrics-service).

This 3-minute video demonstrates how you can adjust your New Relic Event retention in conjunction with E2M for long-term trending:
